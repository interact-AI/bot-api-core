## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform. Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.

## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19

Various governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions, impacting Uber's business. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty globally, affecting future business operations and financial results.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2021, Uber adopted ASU 2021-10 regarding disclosures about government assistance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Uber is evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08 on accounting for contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers, effective after December 15, 2022.

### Mobility Revenue

Uber derives revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for platform use and related services, as well as from end-users for connection services in certain markets. Mobility revenue also includes other immaterial revenue streams.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

During the first quarter of 2022, Uber modified its arrangements in certain markets and concluded that it is responsible for providing mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these transactions, end-users are considered customers, and Uber's sole performance obligation is to provide transportation services. Revenue is recognized when a trip is complete. Revenue from end-users is presented on a gross basis in markets where Uber is responsible for mobility services.

## Delivery Revenue

Revenue for Delivery is derived from Merchants' and Couriers' use of the platform to facilitate and complete delivery transactions. In markets where Uber is responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are included in revenue. Revenue from end-users and cost of revenue for delivery transactions are detailed for the first quarter of 2021 and 2022.

## Freight Revenue

Freight revenue includes revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. Following the acquisition of Transplace, Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.

## All Other Revenue

Prior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to Uber's Advanced Technologies Group ("ATG") business and revenue from New Mobility offerings and products.

## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation

Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had $155 million of contract liabilities. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 was not material. The remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is detailed.

## Investments and Fair Value Measurement

Uber's investments on the balance sheets include non-marketable equity securities, marketable equity securities (Didi, Grab, Aurora, Other), and a note receivable from a related party. The total investments as of March 31, 2022, are provided.

(1) For further information, see Note 4 – Equity Method Investments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.

Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.

Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.

## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-Financial Assets: Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities: Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of these securities is adjusted based on observable transactions or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net.

We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

### MLU B.V. Investment

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $182 million was recorded for the investment in MLU B.V. due to a protracted recession of the Russian economy. Fair value was determined using a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.

### MLU B.V. Basis Difference

The carrying value of the equity method investment includes the basis difference between the original cost and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. Adjustments are made for share in income or losses, amortization, and currency translation adjustments.

## Composition of Basis Difference

|Item|Amount (in millions)|
|---|---|
|Equity method goodwill|$320|
|Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization|$48|
|Deferred tax liabilities|($13)|
|Cumulative currency translation adjustments|($70)|
|Basis difference|$285|

We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.

## MLU B.V. Call Option

On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value, which decreased significantly due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; option term of 1.4 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, Uber will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Uber's election. Uber may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. Uber may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at Uber's option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of Uber's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Uber provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by Uber or any of its subsidiaries.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, Uber used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, Uber's stock price, risk free rate and volatility.

Effective January 1, 2021, Uber early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.

The fair value of Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

## Senior Notes

The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of Uber's material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting Uber's and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. Uber was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.

**Fair Values of Senior Notes as of March 31, 2022 (in millions)**
|2025 Senior Note|$1,044|
|---|---|
|2026 Senior Note|$1,595|

To determine the fair value of our investment in Grab as of March 31, 2021, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario (for example an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a special purpose acquisition company transaction), where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

## Note 9 – Income Taxes

We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.

Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.

## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.

We take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

# Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.|
|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.|
|Freight|Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):

|Segment adjusted EBITDA|Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|

## Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies

### Contingencies

From time to time, Uber is a party to various claims, non-income tax audits, and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2022, Uber had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all legal, regulatory, and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.

Uber is currently a party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business, including alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.

Uber has existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors.

### Driver Classification

California Attorney General Lawsuit: In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018.

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

## Other Legal and Regulatory Matters

Uber has been subject to various government inquiries and investigations related to the legality of business practices, compliance with antitrust laws, labor laws, data protection, and more. The outcomes of these inquiries could have negative impacts on the company's business, reputation, and financial condition.

## Indemnifications

Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in its agreements with third parties, officers, directors, and employees. The maximum potential loss under these provisions cannot be determined due to unique circumstances in each situation.

## Variable Interest Entities

Variable interest entities (VIEs) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities independently. Uber consolidates VIEs where it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary, impacting the company's balance sheets.

### Consolidated VIEs

Uber consolidates VIEs where it has the power to direct activities significantly impacting economic performance. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the balance sheets.

### Unconsolidated VIEs

Uber does not consolidate VIEs where it holds a variable interest but lacks primary beneficiary status. The carrying amount of assets related to unconsolidated VIEs represents the maximum exposure to loss.

### Lime

Uber has investments in Lime, a company operating dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. These investments expose Uber to Lime's economic risks and rewards.

### Moove

Uber has entered into agreements with Moove, a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including an equity investment through preferred shares.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. It also contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.

## Overview

Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Additionally, Uber is involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday problems.

## Driver Classification Developments

Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative, went into effect in December 2020 to provide a framework for drivers working on platforms like Uber. The company has incurred additional expenses to comply with Proposition 22, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers and insurance for injury protection.

In the UK, a tribunal ruled that drivers should be classified as "workers" rather than independent contractors. The Supreme Court of the UK upheld this ruling in February 2021. Uber initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers, including back pay, holiday pay, and minimum wage. More than 70,000 mobility drivers in the UK will now be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage and receiving other benefits.

These developments may have financial implications for Uber but are not expected to have a material impact on the company's business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Components of Results of Operations

We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, or grocery delivery service.

## Revenue

During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these markets, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.

## Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, mobile device costs, and costs incurred for mobility or delivery services where we are primarily responsible.

## Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses include compensation expenses for employees supporting operations, customer support, and Driver background checks.

## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include compensation costs, advertising costs, loyalty programs, promotions, and credits provided to end-users. Expenses are expensed as incurred.

## Research and Development

Research and development expenses include compensation costs for employees in engineering, design, and product development. Expenses are incurred for ongoing improvements and maintenance of existing products and services.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:

- Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.
- Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.
- Gain on business divestiture.
- Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.
- Impairment of equity method investment.
- Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (“MLU B.V. Call Option”).
- Other, net.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.

Equity Method Investments

Equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

** Percentage not meaningful.

Adjusted EBITDA was $168 million, improving $527 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $359 million in the same period in 2021. The improvement was primarily attributable to a $320 million increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA, a $230 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $31 million increase in Freight Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $65 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

We believe that both

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

### Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.

### Investment Risk

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.

### Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

## Legal Actions and Investigations

Uber is involved in legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. The company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could impact its consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.

## Risk Factors

Various factors may have a material adverse effect on Uber's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Some of the key risks include:

- The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Uber's business.
- The classification of Drivers as employees, workers, or independent contractors.
- Competition in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries.
- Significant losses incurred by Uber since inception.
- The importance of maintaining and enhancing Uber's brand and reputation.
- Challenges related to workplace culture and operational compliance.
- The need to optimize organizational structure and manage growth effectively.
- Risks associated with criminal or dangerous activities by platform users.
- Investments in new offerings and technologies.

These risks could adversely affect Uber's financial performance and future prospects.

# Risks Related to Uber Technologies, Inc. Business

## General Economic Risks

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility

## Specific Risks

- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

## Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Uber's financial results in the near term and may continue to impact its long-term financial performance. The company has taken various actions to mitigate these impacts, including workforce reductions and changes to pricing models.

Uber is facing challenges related to driver supply constraints, with consumer demand for mobility recovering faster than driver availability. The suspension of shared rides offerings globally has also impacted the company's operations.

The ultimate impact of the pandemic on Uber's business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations remains uncertain and dependent on various factors such as the duration of the outbreak, vaccine efficacy, and global economic conditions.

## Operational Risks

Uber's business could be adversely affected if drivers are classified as employees, workers, or quasi-employees. The classification of drivers is being challenged in courts and by government agencies, with potential legal and financial implications for the company.

Changes to laws governing the classification of independent contractors, such as California's Assembly Bill 5 and Proposition 22, could impact Uber's operations and require compliance with new regulations.

Legal challenges and uncertainties surrounding the classification of drivers may pose risks to Uber's business and financial condition in the future.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our

# Uber Quarterly Report

# Competition Overview

Uber faces competition in each of its offerings, including:

## Mobility:

Competes with personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, and other ridesharing companies.

## Delivery:

Competes with companies in the meal, grocery, and other delivery space, as well as restaurants and traditional grocers.

## Freight:

Competes with global and North American freight brokers.

Competitors offer discounted services, incentives, and alternative pricing models, posing challenges to Uber's market position.

Uber is contractually restricted from competing with minority-owned affiliates in certain regions until specific dates.

# Market Strategy

To remain competitive, Uber has lowered fares, offered Driver incentives, and consumer promotions, impacting its financial performance.

Driver incentives and discounts are used to generate network scale and liquidity, especially in regions where Uber does not have a leading position.

There is a risk associated with the effectiveness of offering such incentives and promotions.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and service fees have negatively affected Uber's financial performance. Pricing models for consumer fares and Driver earnings have been modified over time and may continue to change in the future. Uber faces competition from well-capitalized competitors who may lower prices, offer incentives, or attract users away from Uber's platform.

Uber has incurred significant losses since inception, with operating losses of $4.9 billion in 2020 and $3.8 billion in 2021. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. Operating expenses are expected to increase, and profitability may not be achieved or maintained in the foreseeable future.

Uber's success depends on attracting and maintaining a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to its platform. Driver supply constraints, impacted by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect liquidity and network scale in geographic markets. Competition and other factors could make Uber's platform less appealing to users, impacting financial results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.

In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. The company has limited experience operating in many international jurisdictions and has been making significant investments to expand its international operations and compete with local and global competitors.

Operating internationally poses various risks that are not as prevalent in the United States. Some of these risks include operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences, localization of business operations to adhere to foreign laws and regulations, competition with local companies that have better market understanding, and legal uncertainties regarding liability for platform users' actions.

Other challenges include managing international operations, dealing with currency exchange fluctuations, navigating different payment methods preferred in various markets, complying with diverse tax systems, and facing political, social, and economic instability in foreign countries.

These risks and challenges could impact Uber's financial results and future prospects if not managed effectively.

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.

Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:

- grow supply and demand on our platform;
- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;
- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;
- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and
- increase positive perception of our brand.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,

Failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.

We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.

In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.

In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.

If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Attracting and retaining personnel is crucial for Uber's effective business operations. The equity incentives used to motivate employees may be less effective if the stock value does not meet expectations.

Economic conditions, including consumer spending trends, can impact Uber's performance. Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and energy prices can influence consumer behavior and affect Uber's business.

Rising costs due to inflation, fuel prices, and supply chain challenges can negatively impact Uber's operating results. These increased costs may lead to drivers and merchants spending less time on the platform.

Security breaches or unauthorized access to data pose significant risks to Uber. Any loss of data or breach of security could result in revenue loss, harm to the brand, and business disruption.

Uber faces challenges in anticipating and preventing security threats, which could lead to data breaches or disruptions in operations. Significant resources may be required to protect against such risks.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the business operations and financial results of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

Below is an excerpt from the report discussing the company's reliance on information technology systems and the potential risks associated with cyberattacks:

We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.

Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.

Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.

We face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.

We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.

We have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

Dependencies on Third Parties

The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.

Our business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.

Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.

We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions.

Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect Uber's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. The company is a U.S.-based multinational subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, and uncertainties remain regarding its impact on Uber's operations.

## Impact of Tax Reforms

Uber faces potential adverse impacts from changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies, and practices in jurisdictions where it operates. These changes could increase tax liabilities, affect financial position, operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates, and increase the complexity of tax compliance.

## Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of December 31, 2021, Uber had significant net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The expiration of these carryforwards could impact future taxable income and potentially affect operating results.

## Currency Exchange Rate Exposure

Uber faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These fluctuations can impact revenue, expenses, and overall financial results.

## Business Acquisitions and Integration

Uber's strategy includes acquiring businesses, and the success of these acquisitions and their integration is crucial. Failure to identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses could harm operating results and prospects.

# Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Uber's Business

Uber Technologies, Inc. faces legal and regulatory risks in various jurisdictions that may impact its operations and financial performance. Some of the key points include:

- In certain jurisdictions like Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, Uber's ridesharing business model has faced challenges due to laws and regulatory restrictions.
- Traditional taxicab and car service operators lobby to impose regulatory requirements on Uber's Mobility products, impacting its financial performance.
- Regulatory decisions in cities like New York City and San Francisco have led to minimum pay standards and surcharges on ridesharing trips, affecting Uber's operations.
- In some jurisdictions, Uber operates under ambiguous or invalid laws, leading to fines and regulatory proceedings.
- Legal challenges in places like Hong Kong and Colombia have affected Uber's ability to offer ridesharing services.

These legal and regulatory challenges may result in fines, penalties, and potential impacts on Uber's ability to operate in certain jurisdictions.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber's platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. The company faces regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by competitors or local governments globally, which may favor local or incumbent competitors. There are increasing proposals for regulations that could significantly impact Uber's business model and operations.

Uber is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect its business and future prospects. Existing and new laws and regulations could expose Uber to substantial liability and increase operating costs. The company is actively challenging some laws and regulations that limit its ability to offer products to drivers and consumers in certain jurisdictions.

Uber is also impacted by environmental regulations related to air pollution and emissions, with initiatives such as adding clean-air fees and transitioning to electric vehicles in certain regions. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to data sharing requirements in various jurisdictions.

Following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ("Brexit") on January 1, 2021, Uber's operations in the UK represented approximately 8.9% of its global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.

Uber is involved in litigation in multiple jurisdictions, with legal challenges initiated by the company and brought by various parties including taxicab owners, regulators, and platform users. These legal proceedings are costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in financial damages or penalties if resolved adversely to Uber.

Despite divesting certain assets of its dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers still have access to these services through Uber's app, presenting additional risks distinct from other offerings.

Overall, Uber faces a complex regulatory and legal landscape that poses challenges to its business operations and growth prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Below are some excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

Using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.

Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient.

For more detailed information, please refer to the full quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the SEC.

This document contains information about the financial performance and relevant disclosures of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

## Payment Operations and Regulations

The company's payment operations are subject to evolving laws related to money transmission and online payments. Changes in these laws could impact Uber's ability to provide payment processing services on its platform. Compliance with financial regulations, including anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, is crucial for the company's operations.

## Government Investigations

Uber is currently facing inquiries and investigations from various government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and state Attorney General offices. These inquiries cover a range of matters such as business practices, data privacy incidents, and regulatory compliance. Adverse outcomes from these investigations could have a negative impact on Uber's business.

### Examples of Past Settlements and Fines

Uber has settled claims related to incidents such as the 2016 data breach, resulting in significant fines and penalties. For instance, settlements with U.S. state Attorneys General and regulatory bodies have amounted to millions of dollars. Ongoing regulatory investigations and litigation pose additional risks to the company.

### Impact on Business and Reputation

Legal actions, fines, and enforcement measures resulting from non-compliance with laws and regulations could harm Uber's financial position and reputation. Negative publicity and erosion of user trust may disrupt the company's operations and growth prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the risks related to data privacy and security as disclosed by Uber Technologies, Inc. in their quarterly report.

## Risks Related to Data Privacy and Security

Uber Technologies, Inc. faces various risks related to the collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and processing of data, which could lead to investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory actions, and negative press about their privacy and data protection practices.

### Legal Actions and Settlements

Uber has been subject to various legal actions, settlements, and fines imposed by regulatory authorities. For example, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations. Additionally, settlements and fines have been imposed by authorities in the UK, Dutch, French, and US states for data security incidents.

### Compliance with Data Privacy Laws

Uber faces challenges in complying with data privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Non-compliance with these laws can result in significant penalties, fines, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.

### Expansion and Compliance Costs

As Uber expands its operations domestically and internationally, it may become subject to amended or additional data privacy and security laws, increasing compliance costs and risks associated with non-compliance. Jurisdictions like Brazil have also introduced data protection laws that impact Uber's operations.

### Insurance Coverage

Uber's insurance programs may not cover all potential claims related to data security incidents, leaving the company exposed to significant liabilities that could impact its business and financial condition.

Overall, Uber Technologies, Inc. faces ongoing challenges and risks related to data privacy and security, which require continuous monitoring and compliance efforts to mitigate potential financial and operational impacts.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.

Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject. We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.

Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform. Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.

We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.

# Uber Quarterly Report

# Uber Quarterly Report

In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.

We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.

We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;
Limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes;
Prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and
Our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.

These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.

## General Risk Factors

As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform. Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.

## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19

Various governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions, impacting Uber's business. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty globally, affecting future business operations and financial results.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2021, Uber adopted ASU 2021-10 regarding disclosures about government assistance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Uber is evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08 on accounting for contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers, effective after December 15, 2022.

### Mobility Revenue

Uber derives revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for platform use and related services, as well as from end-users for connection services in certain markets. Mobility revenue also includes other immaterial revenue streams.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

During the first quarter of 2022, Uber modified its arrangements in certain markets and concluded that it is responsible for providing mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these transactions, end-users are considered customers, and Uber's sole performance obligation is to provide transportation services. Revenue is recognized when a trip is complete. Revenue from end-users is presented on a gross basis in markets where Uber is responsible for mobility services.

## Delivery Revenue

Revenue for Delivery is derived from Merchants' and Couriers' use of the platform to facilitate and complete delivery transactions. In markets where Uber is responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are included in revenue. Revenue from end-users and cost of revenue for delivery transactions are detailed for the first quarter of 2021 and 2022.

## Freight Revenue

Freight revenue includes revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. Following the acquisition of Transplace, Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.

## All Other Revenue

Prior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to Uber's Advanced Technologies Group ("ATG") business and revenue from New Mobility offerings and products.

## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation

Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had $155 million of contract liabilities. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 was not material. The remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is detailed.

## Investments and Fair Value Measurement

Uber's investments on the balance sheets include non-marketable equity securities, marketable equity securities (Didi, Grab, Aurora, Other), and a note receivable from a related party. The total investments as of March 31, 2022, are provided.

(1) For further information, see Note 4 – Equity Method Investments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.

Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.

Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.

## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-Financial Assets: Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities: Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of these securities is adjusted based on observable transactions or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net.

We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

### Summary of Non-Marketable Equity Securities

| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Initial cost basis|$279|$281|
|Upward adjustments|$4|$4|
|Downward adjustments (including impairment)|$0|$0|
|Total carrying value at the end of the period|$283|$285|

### Equity Method Investments

| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|MLU B.V.|$751|$574|
|Mission Bay 3 & 4|$38|$37|
|Other|$11|$13|
|Total equity method investments|$800|$624|

### MLU B.V. Investment

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $182 million was recorded for the investment in MLU B.V. due to a protracted recession of the Russian economy. Fair value was determined using a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.

### MLU B.V. Basis Difference

The carrying value of the equity method investment includes the basis difference between the original cost and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. Adjustments are made for share in income or losses, amortization, and currency translation adjustments.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

## Composition of Basis Difference

|Item|Amount (in millions)|
|---|---|
|Equity method goodwill|$320|
|Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization|$48|
|Deferred tax liabilities|($13)|
|Cumulative currency translation adjustments|($70)|
|Basis difference|$285|

We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.

## MLU B.V. Call Option

On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value, which decreased significantly due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; option term of 1.4 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, Uber will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Uber's election. Uber may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. Uber may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at Uber's option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of Uber's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Uber provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by Uber or any of its subsidiaries.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, Uber used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, Uber's stock price, risk free rate and volatility.

Effective January 1, 2021, Uber early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.

The fair value of Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

## Senior Notes

The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of Uber's material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting Uber's and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. Uber was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.

**Fair Values of Senior Notes as of March 31, 2022 (in millions)**
|2025 Senior Note|$1,044|
|---|---|
|2026 Senior Note|$1,595|
|2027 Senior Note|$1,281|

## Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The changes in composition of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, were as follows (in millions):

| |Unrealized Gains (Losses)|
|---|---|
| |Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments|on Available-for-Sale Securities, Net of Tax|Total|
|Balance as of December 31, 2020|($581)|$46|($535)|
|Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications|33|1,156|1,189|
|Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)|—|—|—|
|Other comprehensive income (loss)|33|1,156|1,189|
|Balance as of March 31, 2021|($548)|$1,202|$654|

(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2021, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax relates to pre-tax unrealized gains of $1.3 billion for the change in fair value of our investment in Grab. To determine the fair value of our investment in Grab as of March 31, 2021, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario (for example an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a special purpose acquisition company transaction), where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

## Note 9 – Income Taxes

We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.

Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.

## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.

We take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

# Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.|
|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.|
|Freight|Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):

|Segment adjusted EBITDA|Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Mobility|$298|$618|
|Delivery|($200)|$30|
|Freight|($29)|$2|
|All Other|($11)|—|
|Total segment adjusted EBITDA|$58|$650|

## Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies

### Contingencies

From time to time, Uber is a party to various claims, non-income tax audits, and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2022, Uber had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all legal, regulatory, and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.

Uber is currently a party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business, including alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.

Uber has existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors.

### Driver Classification

California Attorney General Lawsuit: In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018.

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

## Other Legal and Regulatory Matters

Uber has been subject to various government inquiries and investigations related to the legality of business practices, compliance with antitrust laws, labor laws, data protection, and more. The outcomes of these inquiries could have negative impacts on the company's business, reputation, and financial condition.

## Indemnifications

Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in its agreements with third parties, officers, directors, and employees. The maximum potential loss under these provisions cannot be determined due to unique circumstances in each situation.

## Variable Interest Entities

Variable interest entities (VIEs) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities independently. Uber consolidates VIEs where it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary, impacting the company's balance sheets.

### Consolidated VIEs

Uber consolidates VIEs where it has the power to direct activities significantly impacting economic performance. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the balance sheets.

### Unconsolidated VIEs

Uber does not consolidate VIEs where it holds a variable interest but lacks primary beneficiary status. The carrying amount of assets related to unconsolidated VIEs represents the maximum exposure to loss.

### Lime

Uber has investments in Lime, a company operating dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. These investments expose Uber to Lime's economic risks and rewards.

### Moove

Uber has entered into agreements with Moove, a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including an equity investment through preferred shares.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. It also contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.

## Overview

Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Additionally, Uber is involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday problems.

## Driver Classification Developments

Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative, went into effect in December 2020 to provide a framework for drivers working on platforms like Uber. The company has incurred additional expenses to comply with Proposition 22, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers and insurance for injury protection.

In the UK, a tribunal ruled that drivers should be classified as "workers" rather than independent contractors. The Supreme Court of the UK upheld this ruling in February 2021. Uber initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers, including back pay, holiday pay, and minimum wage. More than 70,000 mobility drivers in the UK will now be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage and receiving other benefits.

These developments may have financial implications for Uber but are not expected to have a material impact on the company's business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Components of Results of Operations

We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, or grocery delivery service.

## Revenue

During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these markets, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.

## Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, mobile device costs, and costs incurred for mobility or delivery services where we are primarily responsible.

## Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses include compensation expenses for employees supporting operations, customer support, and Driver background checks.

## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include compensation costs, advertising costs, loyalty programs, promotions, and credits provided to end-users. Expenses are expensed as incurred.

## Research and Development

Research and development expenses include compensation costs for employees in engineering, design, and product development. Expenses are incurred for ongoing improvements and maintenance of existing products and services.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:

- Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.
- Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.
- Gain on business divestiture.
- Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.
- Impairment of equity method investment.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.

Equity Method Investments

Equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

# Uber Quarterly Report

## Summary of Financial Performance

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. reported the following financial highlights:

### Mobility Segment

Adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily due to higher Mobility revenue, partially offset by increased insurance expenses and credit card processing costs.

### Delivery Segment

Delivery revenue increased by $771 million, or 44%, with Delivery adjusted EBITDA growing by $230 million, or 115%. The increase in revenue was driven by higher Delivery Gross Bookings and improved Take Rate.

### Freight Segment

Freight revenue surged by $1.5 billion, or 506%, with Freight adjusted EBITDA growing by $31 million, or 107%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of Transplace and growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network.

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

### Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.

### Investment Risk

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.

### Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

## Legal Actions and Investigations

Uber is involved in legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. The company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could impact its consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.

## Risk Factors

Various factors may have a material adverse effect on Uber's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Some of the key risks include:

- The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Uber's business.
- The classification of Drivers as employees, workers, or independent contractors.
- Competition in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries.
- Significant losses incurred by Uber since inception.
- The importance of maintaining and enhancing Uber's brand and reputation.
- Challenges related to workplace culture and operational compliance.
- The need to optimize organizational structure and manage growth effectively.
- Risks associated with criminal or dangerous activities by platform users.
- Investments in new offerings and technologies.

These risks could adversely affect Uber's financial performance and future prospects.

# Risks Related to Uber Technologies, Inc. Business

## General Economic Risks

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility

## Specific Risks

- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.

This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

## Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Uber's financial results in the near term and may continue to impact its long-term financial performance. The company has taken various actions to mitigate these impacts, including workforce reductions and changes to pricing models.

Uber is facing challenges related to driver supply constraints, with consumer demand for mobility recovering faster than driver availability. The suspension of shared rides offerings globally has also impacted the company's operations.

The ultimate impact of the pandemic on Uber's business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations remains uncertain and dependent on various factors such as the duration of the outbreak, vaccine efficacy, and global economic conditions.

## Operational Risks

Uber's business could be adversely affected if drivers are classified as employees, workers, or quasi-employees. The classification of drivers is being challenged in courts and by government agencies, with potential legal and financial implications for the company.

Changes to laws governing the classification of independent contractors, such as California's Assembly Bill 5 and Proposition 22, could impact Uber's operations and require compliance with new regulations.

Legal challenges and uncertainties surrounding the classification of drivers may pose risks to Uber's business and financial condition in the future.

Disclaimer: This is a summary of select sections of the quarterly report and may not include all details. For comprehensive information, refer to the original document filed with the SEC.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our

# Competition Overview

Uber faces competition in each of its offerings, including:

## Mobility:

Competes with personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, and other ridesharing companies.

## Delivery:

Competes with companies in the meal, grocery, and other delivery space, as well as restaurants and traditional grocers.

## Freight:

Competes with global and North American freight brokers.

Competitors offer discounted services, incentives, and alternative pricing models, posing challenges to Uber's market position.

Uber is contractually restricted from competing with minority-owned affiliates in certain regions until specific dates.

# Market Strategy

To remain competitive, Uber has lowered fares, offered Driver incentives, and consumer promotions, impacting its financial performance.

Driver incentives and discounts are used to generate network scale and liquidity, especially in regions where Uber does not have a leading position.

There is a risk associated with the effectiveness of offering such incentives and promotions.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and service fees have negatively affected Uber's financial performance. Pricing models for consumer fares and Driver earnings have been modified over time and may continue to change in the future. Uber faces competition from well-capitalized competitors who may lower prices, offer incentives, or attract users away from Uber's platform.

Uber has incurred significant losses since inception, with operating losses of $4.9 billion in 2020 and $3.8 billion in 2021. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. Operating expenses are expected to increase, and profitability may not be achieved or maintained in the foreseeable future.

Uber's success depends on attracting and maintaining a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to its platform. Driver supply constraints, impacted by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect liquidity and network scale in geographic markets. Competition and other factors could make Uber's platform less appealing to users, impacting financial results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.

In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. The company has limited experience operating in many international jurisdictions and has been making significant investments to expand its international operations and compete with local and global competitors.

Operating internationally poses various risks that are not as prevalent in the United States. Some of these risks include operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences, localization of business operations to adhere to foreign laws and regulations, competition with local companies that have better market understanding, and legal uncertainties regarding liability for platform users' actions.

Other challenges include managing international operations, dealing with currency exchange fluctuations, navigating different payment methods preferred in various markets, complying with diverse tax systems, and facing political, social, and economic instability in foreign countries.

These risks and challenges could impact Uber's financial results and future prospects if not managed effectively.

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.

Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:

- grow supply and demand on our platform;
- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;
- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;
- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and
- increase positive perception of our brand.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,

Failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.

We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.

In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.

In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.

If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Attracting and retaining personnel is crucial for Uber's effective business operations. The equity incentives used to motivate employees may be less effective if the stock value does not meet expectations.

Economic conditions, including consumer spending trends, can impact Uber's performance. Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and energy prices can influence consumer behavior and affect Uber's business.

Rising costs due to inflation, fuel prices, and supply chain challenges can negatively impact Uber's operating results. These increased costs may lead to drivers and merchants spending less time on the platform.

Security breaches or unauthorized access to data pose significant risks to Uber. Any loss of data or breach of security could result in revenue loss, harm to the brand, and business disruption.

Uber faces challenges in anticipating and preventing security threats, which could lead to data breaches or disruptions in operations. Significant resources may be required to protect against such risks.

This document contains information about the security breaches and data incidents faced by Uber Technologies, Inc. in the past and potential risks in the future.

## Security Breaches and Data Incidents

Uber has experienced security and privacy incidents in the past, such as the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach, which exposed personal information of drivers and consumers. These incidents could lead to liabilities under various laws and regulations, as well as litigation and governmental investigations.

## Liabilities and Risks

Uber may face liabilities for breaches experienced by acquired companies like Careem and Drizly. Failure to remediate data security incidents could result in harm to the brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

## Product Development and User Retention

Uber needs to introduce new products and features to retain and attract drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. Failure to do so may adversely affect operating results.

## Operational Metrics and Challenges

Uber tracks operational metrics internally, which may differ from third-party estimates. Inaccuracies in metrics could harm reputation and negatively affect the business.

Below are some key points from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission:

1. Uber faces challenges related to the use of multiple accounts by consumers, inaccuracies in operating metrics, and regulatory concerns regarding cash payments in certain jurisdictions.

2. Cash payments for trips and deliveries accounted for approximately 7% of global Gross Bookings in 2021, with potential for increase in the future.

3. The use of cash raises regulatory, operational, and safety concerns, including compliance risks and safety incidents for both Drivers and riders.

4. Loss or modification of credit card acceptance privileges could significantly impact Uber's business model, as 74% of Gross Bookings were paid by credit or debit cards in 2021.

5. Cyberattacks, including malware and phishing attacks, pose a threat to Uber's reputation and operations.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the business operations and financial results of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

Below is an excerpt from the report discussing the company's reliance on information technology systems and the potential risks associated with cyberattacks:

We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.

Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.

Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.

We face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.

We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.

We have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

Dependencies on Third Parties

The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.

Our business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.

Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.

We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive

Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect Uber's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. The company is a U.S.-based multinational subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, and uncertainties remain regarding its impact on Uber's operations.

## Impact of Tax Reforms

Uber faces potential adverse impacts from changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies, and practices in jurisdictions where it operates. These changes could increase tax liabilities, affect financial position, operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates, and increase the complexity of tax compliance.

## Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of December 31, 2021, Uber had significant net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The expiration of these carryforwards could impact future taxable income and potentially affect operating results.

## Currency Exchange Rate Exposure

Uber faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These fluctuations can impact revenue, expenses, and overall financial results.

## Business Acquisitions and Integration

Uber's strategy includes acquiring businesses, and the success of these acquisitions and their integration is crucial. Failure to identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses could harm operating results and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber's platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. The company faces regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by competitors or local governments globally, which may favor local or incumbent competitors. There are increasing proposals for regulations that could significantly impact Uber's business model and operations.

Uber is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect its business and future prospects. Existing and new laws and regulations could expose Uber to substantial liability and increase operating costs. The company is actively challenging some laws and regulations that limit its ability to offer products to drivers and consumers in certain jurisdictions.

Uber is also impacted by environmental regulations related to air pollution and emissions, with initiatives such as adding clean-air fees and transitioning to electric vehicles in certain regions. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to data sharing requirements in various jurisdictions.

Following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ("Brexit") on January 1, 2021, Uber's operations in the UK represented approximately 8.9% of its global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.

Uber is involved in litigation in multiple jurisdictions, with legal challenges initiated by the company and brought by various parties including taxicab owners, regulators, and platform users. These legal proceedings are costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in financial damages or penalties if resolved adversely to Uber.

Despite divesting certain assets of its dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers still have access to these services through Uber's app, presenting additional risks distinct from other offerings.

Overall, Uber faces a complex regulatory and legal landscape that poses challenges to its business operations and growth prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Below are some excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

Using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.

Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient.

For more detailed information, please refer to the full quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the SEC.

Changes in these laws could impact Uber's ability to provide payment processing services on its platform. Compliance with financial regulations, including anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, is crucial for the company's operations.

## Government Investigations

Uber is currently facing inquiries and investigations from various government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and state Attorney General offices. These inquiries cover a range of matters such as business practices, data privacy incidents, and regulatory compliance. Adverse outcomes from these investigations could have a negative impact on Uber's business.

### Examples of Past Settlements and Fines

Uber has settled claims related to incidents such as the 2016 data breach, resulting in significant fines and penalties. For instance, settlements with U.S. state Attorneys General and regulatory bodies have amounted to millions of dollars. Ongoing regulatory investigations and litigation pose additional risks to the company.

### Impact on Business and Reputation

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the risks related to data privacy and security as disclosed by Uber Technologies, Inc. in their quarterly report.

## Risks Related to Data Privacy and Security

Uber Technologies, Inc. faces various risks related to the collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and processing of data, which could lead to investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory actions, and negative press about their privacy and data protection practices.

### Legal Actions and Settlements

Uber has been subject to various legal actions, settlements, and fines imposed by regulatory authorities. For example, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations. Additionally, settlements and fines have been imposed by authorities in the UK, Dutch, French, and US states for data security incidents.

### Compliance with Data Privacy Laws

Uber faces challenges in complying with data privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Non-compliance with these laws can result in significant penalties, fines, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.

### Expansion and Compliance Costs

As Uber expands its operations domestically and internationally, it may become subject to amended or additional data privacy and security laws, increasing compliance costs and risks associated with non-compliance. Jurisdictions like Brazil have also introduced data protection laws that impact Uber's operations.

### Insurance Coverage

Uber's insurance programs may not cover all potential claims related to data security incidents, leaving the company exposed to significant liabilities that could impact its business and financial condition.

Overall, Uber Technologies, Inc. faces ongoing challenges and risks related to data privacy and security, which require continuous monitoring and compliance efforts to mitigate potential financial and operational impacts.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.

Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject. We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.

Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform. Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.

We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.

# Uber Quarterly Report

In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.

We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.

We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be

The report includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

## Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

The market price of Uber's common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly due to various factors beyond the company's control. These factors include:

- Fluctuations in financial results such as MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, and revenue
- Announcements or estimates regarding changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on the platform
- Differences between actual operating results and expectations of management, analysts, and investors
- Changes in accounting principles or interpretations
- Actions of securities analysts and changes in financial estimates
- Announcements by Uber or competitors regarding products, features, acquisitions, partnerships, or capital commitments
- Negative media coverage
- Changes in industry performance and stock market valuations
- Legal threats or actions against the company
- Regulatory developments or rulings
- Changes in board of directors or management
- Safety incidents or public reports affecting the platform or industry
- Statements by public officials regarding legality of products
- External events like wars, terrorism, natural disasters, and pandemics

Stock price fluctuations in the market can impact Uber's stock price irrespective of its operating performance. Securities litigation and regulatory challenges could also affect the company's stock price and business operations.

Delaware law and provisions in Uber's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make certain corporate actions difficult, potentially affecting the trading price of the common stock.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;
Limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes;
Prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and
Our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.

These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.

## General Risk Factors

As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform. Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.

## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19

Various governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions, impacting Uber's business. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty globally, affecting future business operations and financial results.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2021, Uber adopted ASU 2021-10 regarding disclosures about government assistance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Uber is evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08 on accounting for contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers, effective after December 15, 2022.

|Total revenue|$2,903 million|$6,854 million|

### Mobility Revenue

Uber derives revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for platform use and related services, as well as from end-users for connection services in certain markets. Mobility revenue also includes other immaterial revenue streams.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

During the first quarter of 2022, Uber modified its arrangements in certain markets and concluded that it is responsible for providing mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these transactions, end-users are considered customers, and Uber's sole performance obligation is to provide transportation services. Revenue is recognized when a trip is complete. Revenue from end-users is presented on a gross basis in markets where Uber is responsible for mobility services.

## Delivery Revenue

Revenue for Delivery is derived from Merchants' and Couriers' use of the platform to facilitate and complete delivery transactions. In markets where Uber is responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are included in revenue. Revenue from end-users and cost of revenue for delivery transactions are detailed for the first quarter of 2021 and 2022.

## Freight Revenue

Freight revenue includes revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. Following the acquisition of Transplace, Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.

## All Other Revenue

Prior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to Uber's Advanced Technologies Group ("ATG") business and revenue from New Mobility offerings and products.

## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation

Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had $155 million of contract liabilities. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 was not material. The remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is detailed.

## Investments and Fair Value Measurement

Uber's investments on the balance sheets include non-marketable equity securities, marketable equity securities (Didi, Grab, Aurora, Other), and a note receivable from a related party. The total investments as of March 31, 2022, are provided.

(1) For further information, see Note 4 – Equity Method Investments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.

Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.

Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.

## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-Financial Assets: Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities: Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of these securities is adjusted based on observable transactions or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net.

We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

### MLU B.V. Investment

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $182 million was recorded for the investment in MLU B.V. due to a protracted recession of the Russian economy. Fair value was determined using a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.

### MLU B.V. Basis Difference

The carrying value of the equity method investment includes the basis difference between the original cost and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. Adjustments are made for share in income or losses, amortization, and currency translation adjustments.

## Composition of Basis Difference

|Item|Amount (in millions)|
|---|---|
|Equity method goodwill|$320|
|Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization|$48|
|Deferred tax liabilities|($13)|
|Cumulative currency translation adjustments|($70)|
|Basis difference|$285|

We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.

## MLU B.V. Call Option

On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value, which decreased significantly due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; option term of 1.4 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, Uber will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Uber's election. Uber may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. Uber may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at Uber's option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of Uber's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Uber provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by Uber or any of its subsidiaries.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, Uber used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, Uber's stock price, risk free rate and volatility.

Effective January 1, 2021, Uber early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.

The fair value of Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

## Senior Notes

The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of Uber's material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting Uber's and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. Uber was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.

**Fair Values of Senior Notes as of March 31, 2022 (in millions)**
|2025 Senior Note|$1,044|

To determine the fair value of our investment in Grab as of March 31, 2021, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario (for example an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a special purpose acquisition company transaction), where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

## Note 9 – Income Taxes

We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.

Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.

## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.

We take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

# Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.|
|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.|
|Freight|Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):

|Segment adjusted EBITDA|Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|

### Contingencies

From time to time, Uber is a party to various claims, non-income tax audits, and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2022, Uber had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all legal, regulatory, and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.

Uber is currently a party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business, including alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.

Uber has existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors.

### Driver Classification

California Attorney General Lawsuit: In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018.

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

## Other Legal and Regulatory Matters

Uber has been subject to various government inquiries and investigations related to the legality of business practices, compliance with antitrust laws, labor laws, data protection, and more. The outcomes of these inquiries could have negative impacts on the company's business, reputation, and financial condition.

## Indemnifications

Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in its agreements with third parties, officers, directors, and employees. The maximum potential loss under these provisions cannot be determined due to unique circumstances in each situation.

## Variable Interest Entities

Variable interest entities (VIEs) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities independently. Uber consolidates VIEs where it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary, impacting the company's balance sheets.

### Consolidated VIEs

Uber consolidates VIEs where it has the power to direct activities significantly impacting economic performance. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the balance sheets.

### Unconsolidated VIEs

Uber does not consolidate VIEs where it holds a variable interest but lacks primary beneficiary status. The carrying amount of assets related to unconsolidated VIEs represents the maximum exposure to loss.

### Lime

Uber has investments in Lime, a company operating dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. These investments expose Uber to Lime's economic risks and rewards.

### Moove

Uber has entered into agreements with Moove, a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including an equity investment through preferred shares.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. It also contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.

## Overview

Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Additionally, Uber is involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday problems.

## Driver Classification Developments

Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative, went into effect in December 2020 to provide a framework for drivers working on platforms like Uber. The company has incurred additional expenses to comply with Proposition 22, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers and insurance for injury protection.

In the UK, a tribunal ruled that drivers should be classified as "workers" rather than independent contractors. The Supreme Court of the UK upheld this ruling in February 2021. Uber initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers, including back pay, holiday pay, and minimum wage. More than 70,000 mobility drivers in the UK will now be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage and receiving other benefits.

These developments may have financial implications for Uber but are not expected to have a material impact on the company's business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Components of Results of Operations

We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, or grocery delivery service.

## Revenue

During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these markets, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.

## Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, mobile device costs, and costs incurred for mobility or delivery services where we are primarily responsible.

## Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses include compensation expenses for employees supporting operations, customer support, and Driver background checks.

## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include compensation costs, advertising costs, loyalty programs, promotions, and credits provided to end-users. Expenses are expensed as incurred.

## Research and Development

Research and development expenses include compensation costs for employees in engineering, design, and product development. Expenses are incurred for ongoing improvements and maintenance of existing products and services.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:

- Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.
- Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.
- Gain on business divestiture.
- Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.
- Impairment of equity method investment.
- Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (“MLU B.V. Call Option”).
- Other, net.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.

Equity Method Investments

Equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

## Summary of Financial Performance

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. reported the following financial highlights:

Adjusted EBITDA was $168 million, improving $527 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $359 million in the same period in 2021. The improvement was primarily attributable to a $320 million increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA, a $230 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $31 million increase in Freight Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $65 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

We believe that both

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

### Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.

### Investment Risk

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.

### Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

## Legal Actions and Investigations

Uber is involved in legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. The company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could impact its consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.

## Risk Factors

Various factors may have a material adverse effect on Uber's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Some of the key risks include:

- The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Uber's business.
- The classification of Drivers as employees, workers, or independent contractors.
- Competition in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries.
- Significant losses incurred by Uber since inception.
- The importance of maintaining and enhancing Uber's brand and reputation.
- Challenges related to workplace culture and operational compliance.
- The need to optimize organizational structure and manage growth effectively.
- Risks associated with criminal or dangerous activities by platform users.
- Investments in new offerings and technologies.

These risks could adversely affect Uber's financial performance and future prospects.

# Risks Related to Uber Technologies, Inc. Business

## General Economic Risks

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility

## Specific Risks

- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

## Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Uber's financial results in the near term and may continue to impact its long-term financial performance. The company has taken various actions to mitigate these impacts, including workforce reductions and changes to pricing models.

Uber is facing challenges related to driver supply constraints, with consumer demand for mobility recovering faster than driver availability. The suspension of shared rides offerings globally has also impacted the company's operations.

The ultimate impact of the pandemic on Uber's business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations remains uncertain and dependent on various factors such as the duration of the outbreak, vaccine efficacy, and global economic conditions.

## Operational Risks

Uber's business could be adversely affected if drivers are classified as employees, workers, or quasi-employees. The classification of drivers is being challenged in courts and by government agencies, with potential legal and financial implications for the company.

Changes to laws governing the classification of independent contractors, such as California's Assembly Bill 5 and Proposition 22, could impact Uber's operations and require compliance with new regulations.

Legal challenges and uncertainties surrounding the classification of drivers may pose risks to Uber's business and financial condition in the future.

Disclaimer: This is a summary of select sections of the quarterly report and may not include all details. For comprehensive information, refer to the original document filed with the SEC.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our

# Uber Quarterly Report

# Competition Overview

Uber faces competition in each of its offerings, including:

## Mobility:

Competes with personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, and other ridesharing companies.

## Delivery:

Competes with companies in the meal, grocery, and other delivery space, as well as restaurants and traditional grocers.

## Freight:

Competes with global and North American freight brokers.

Competitors offer discounted services, incentives, and alternative pricing models, posing challenges to Uber's market position.

Uber is contractually restricted from competing with minority-owned affiliates in certain regions until specific dates.

# Market Strategy

To remain competitive, Uber has lowered fares, offered Driver incentives, and consumer promotions, impacting its financial performance.

Driver incentives and discounts are used to generate network scale and liquidity, especially in regions where Uber does not have a leading position.

There is a risk associated with the effectiveness of offering such incentives and promotions.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and service fees have negatively affected Uber's financial performance. Pricing models for consumer fares and Driver earnings have been modified over time and may continue to change in the future. Uber faces competition from well-capitalized competitors who may lower prices, offer incentives, or attract users away from Uber's platform.

Uber has incurred significant losses since inception, with operating losses of $4.9 billion in 2020 and $3.8 billion in 2021. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. Operating expenses are expected to increase, and profitability may not be achieved or maintained in the foreseeable future.

Uber's success depends on attracting and maintaining a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to its platform. Driver supply constraints, impacted by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect liquidity and network scale in geographic markets. Competition and other factors could make Uber's platform less appealing to users, impacting financial results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.

In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. The company has limited experience operating in many international jurisdictions and has been making significant investments to expand its international operations and compete with local and global competitors.

Operating internationally poses various risks that are not as prevalent in the United States. Some of these risks include operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences, localization of business operations to adhere to foreign laws and regulations, competition with local companies that have better market understanding, and legal uncertainties regarding liability for platform users' actions.

Other challenges include managing international operations, dealing with currency exchange fluctuations, navigating different payment methods preferred in various markets, complying with diverse tax systems, and facing political, social, and economic instability in foreign countries.

These risks and challenges could impact Uber's financial results and future prospects if not managed effectively.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.

Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:

- grow supply and demand on our platform;
- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;
- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;
- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and
- increase positive perception of our brand.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,

Failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.

We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.

In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.

In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.

If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Attracting and retaining personnel is crucial for Uber's effective business operations. The equity incentives used to motivate employees may be less effective if the stock value does not meet expectations.

Economic conditions, including consumer spending trends, can impact Uber's performance. Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and energy prices can influence consumer behavior and affect Uber's business.

Rising costs due to inflation, fuel prices, and supply chain challenges can negatively impact Uber's operating results. These increased costs may lead to drivers and merchants spending less time on the platform.

Security breaches or unauthorized access to data pose significant risks to Uber. Any loss of data or breach of security could result in revenue loss, harm to the brand, and business disruption.

Uber faces challenges in anticipating and preventing security threats, which could lead to data breaches or disruptions in operations. Significant resources may be required to protect against such risks.

For more detailed information, please refer to the complete quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the business operations and financial results of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

Below is an excerpt from the report discussing the company's reliance on information technology systems and the potential risks associated with cyberattacks:

We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.

Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.

Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.

We face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.

We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.

We have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

Dependencies on Third Parties

The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.

Our business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.

Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.

We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions.

Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect Uber's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. The company is a U.S.-based multinational subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, and uncertainties remain regarding its impact on Uber's operations.

## Impact of Tax Reforms

Uber faces potential adverse impacts from changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies, and practices in jurisdictions where it operates. These changes could increase tax liabilities, affect financial position, operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates, and increase the complexity of tax compliance.

## Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of December 31, 2021, Uber had significant net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The expiration of these carryforwards could impact future taxable income and potentially affect operating results.

## Currency Exchange Rate Exposure

Uber faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These fluctuations can impact revenue, expenses, and overall financial results.

## Business Acquisitions and Integration

Uber's strategy includes acquiring businesses, and the success of these acquisitions and their integration is crucial. Failure to identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses could harm operating results and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber's platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. The company faces regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by competitors or local governments globally, which may favor local or incumbent competitors. There are increasing proposals for regulations that could significantly impact Uber's business model and operations.

Uber is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect its business and future prospects. Existing and new laws and regulations could expose Uber to substantial liability and increase operating costs. The company is actively challenging some laws and regulations that limit its ability to offer products to drivers and consumers in certain jurisdictions.

Uber is also impacted by environmental regulations related to air pollution and emissions, with initiatives such as adding clean-air fees and transitioning to electric vehicles in certain regions. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to data sharing requirements in various jurisdictions.

Following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ("Brexit") on January 1, 2021, Uber's operations in the UK represented approximately 8.9% of its global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.

Uber is involved in litigation in multiple jurisdictions, with legal challenges initiated by the company and brought by various parties including taxicab owners, regulators, and platform users. These legal proceedings are costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in financial damages or penalties if resolved adversely to Uber.

Despite divesting certain assets of its dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers still have access to these services through Uber's app, presenting additional risks distinct from other offerings.

Overall, Uber faces a complex regulatory and legal landscape that poses challenges to its business operations and growth prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Below are some excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

Using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.

Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient.

This document contains information about the financial performance and relevant disclosures of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

## Payment Operations and Regulations

The company's payment operations are subject to evolving laws related to money transmission and online payments. Changes in these laws could impact Uber's ability to provide payment processing services on its platform. Compliance with financial regulations, including anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, is crucial for the company's operations.

## Government Investigations

Uber is currently facing inquiries and investigations from various government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and state Attorney General offices. These inquiries cover a range of matters such as business practices, data privacy incidents, and regulatory compliance. Adverse outcomes from these investigations could have a negative impact on Uber's business.

### Examples of Past Settlements and Fines

Uber has settled claims related to incidents such as the 2016 data breach, resulting in significant fines and penalties. For instance, settlements with U.S. state Attorneys General and regulatory bodies have amounted to millions of dollars. Ongoing regulatory investigations and litigation pose additional risks to the company.

### Impact on Business and Reputation

Legal actions, fines, and enforcement measures resulting from non-compliance with laws and regulations could harm Uber's financial position and reputation. Negative publicity and erosion of user trust may disrupt the company's operations and growth prospects.

This document contains information about the risks related to data privacy and security as disclosed by Uber Technologies, Inc. in their quarterly report.

## Risks Related to Data Privacy and Security

Uber Technologies, Inc. faces various risks related to the collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and processing of data, which could lead to investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory actions, and negative press about their privacy and data protection practices.

### Legal Actions and Settlements

Uber has been subject to various legal actions, settlements, and fines imposed by regulatory authorities. For example, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations. Additionally, settlements and fines have been imposed by authorities in the UK, Dutch, French, and US states for data security incidents.

### Compliance with Data Privacy Laws

Uber faces challenges in complying with data privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Non-compliance with these laws can result in significant penalties, fines, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.

### Expansion and Compliance Costs

As Uber expands its operations domestically and internationally, it may become subject to amended or additional data privacy and security laws, increasing compliance costs and risks associated with non-compliance. Jurisdictions like Brazil have also introduced data protection laws that impact Uber's operations.

### Insurance Coverage

Uber's insurance programs may not cover all potential claims related to data security incidents, leaving the company exposed to significant liabilities that could impact its business and financial condition.

Overall, Uber Technologies, Inc. faces ongoing challenges and risks related to data privacy and security, which require continuous monitoring and compliance efforts to mitigate potential financial and operational impacts.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.

Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject. We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.

Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform. Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.

We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.

# Uber Quarterly Report

# Uber Quarterly Report

In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.

We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.

We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;
Limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes;
Prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and
Our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.

These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.

## General Risk Factors

As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform. Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.

## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19

Various governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions, impacting Uber's business. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty globally, affecting future business operations and financial results.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2021, Uber adopted ASU 2021-10 regarding disclosures about government assistance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Uber is evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08 on accounting for contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers, effective after December 15, 2022.

### Mobility Revenue

Uber derives revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for platform use and related services, as well as from end-users for connection services in certain markets. Mobility revenue also includes other immaterial revenue streams.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

During the first quarter of 2022, Uber modified its arrangements in certain markets and concluded that it is responsible for providing mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these transactions, end-users are considered customers, and Uber's sole performance obligation is to provide transportation services. Revenue is recognized when a trip is complete. Revenue from end-users is presented on a gross basis in markets where Uber is responsible for mobility services.

## Delivery Revenue

Revenue for Delivery is derived from Merchants' and Couriers' use of the platform to facilitate and complete delivery transactions. In markets where Uber is responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are included in revenue. Revenue from end-users and cost of revenue for delivery transactions are detailed for the first quarter of 2021 and 2022.

## Freight Revenue

Freight revenue includes revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. Following the acquisition of Transplace, Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.

## All Other Revenue

Prior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to Uber's Advanced Technologies Group ("ATG") business and revenue from New Mobility offerings and products.

## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation

Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had $155 million of contract liabilities. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 was not material. The remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is detailed.

## Investments and Fair Value Measurement

Uber's investments on the balance sheets include non-marketable equity securities, marketable equity securities (Didi, Grab, Aurora, Other), and a note receivable from a related party. The total investments as of March 31, 2022, are provided.

(1) For further information, see Note 4 – Equity Method Investments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.

Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.

Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.

## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-Financial Assets: Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities: Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of these securities is adjusted based on observable transactions or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net.

We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

### Summary of Non-Marketable Equity Securities

| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Initial cost basis|$279|$281|
|Upward adjustments|$4|$4|
|Downward adjustments (including impairment)|$0|$0|
|Total carrying value at the end of the period|$283|$285|

### Equity Method Investments

| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|MLU B.V.|$751|$574|
|Mission Bay 3 & 4|$38|$37|
|Other|$11|$13|
|Total equity method investments|$800|$624|

### MLU B.V. Investment

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $182 million was recorded for the investment in MLU B.V. due to a protracted recession of the Russian economy. Fair value was determined using a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.

### MLU B.V. Basis Difference

The carrying value of the equity method investment includes the basis difference between the original cost and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. Adjustments are made for share in income or losses, amortization, and currency translation adjustments.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

## Composition of Basis Difference

|Item|Amount (in millions)|
|---|---|
|Equity method goodwill|$320|
|Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization|$48|
|Deferred tax liabilities|($13)|
|Cumulative currency translation adjustments|($70)|
|Basis difference|$285|

We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.

## MLU B.V. Call Option

On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value, which decreased significantly due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; option term of 1.4 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, Uber will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Uber's election. Uber may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. Uber may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at Uber's option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of Uber's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Uber provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by Uber or any of its subsidiaries.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, Uber used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, Uber's stock price, risk free rate and volatility.

Effective January 1, 2021, Uber early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.

The fair value of Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

## Senior Notes

The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of Uber's material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting Uber's and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. Uber was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.

**Fair Values of Senior Notes as of March 31, 2022 (in millions)**
|2025 Senior Note|$1,044|
|---|---|
|2026 Senior Note|$1,595|
|2027 Senior Note|$1,281|

(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2021, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax relates to pre-tax unrealized gains of $1.3 billion for the change in fair value of our investment in Grab. To determine the fair value of our investment in Grab as of March 31, 2021, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario (for example an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a special purpose acquisition company transaction), where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

## Note 9 – Income Taxes

We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.

Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.

## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.

We take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

# Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.|
|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.|
|Freight|Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):

|Segment adjusted EBITDA|Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Mobility|$298|$618|
|Delivery|($200)|$30|

## Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies

### Contingencies

From time to time, Uber is a party to various claims, non-income tax audits, and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2022, Uber had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all legal, regulatory, and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.

Uber is currently a party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business, including alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.

Uber has existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors.

### Driver Classification

California Attorney General Lawsuit: In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018.

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

## Other Legal and Regulatory Matters

Uber has been subject to various government inquiries and investigations related to the legality of business practices, compliance with antitrust laws, labor laws, data protection, and more. The outcomes of these inquiries could have negative impacts on the company's business, reputation, and financial condition.

## Indemnifications

Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in its agreements with third parties, officers, directors, and employees. The maximum potential loss under these provisions cannot be determined due to unique circumstances in each situation.

## Variable Interest Entities

Variable interest entities (VIEs) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities independently. Uber consolidates VIEs where it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary, impacting the company's balance sheets.

### Consolidated VIEs

Uber consolidates VIEs where it has the power to direct activities significantly impacting economic performance. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the balance sheets.

### Unconsolidated VIEs

Uber does not consolidate VIEs where it holds a variable interest but lacks primary beneficiary status. The carrying amount of assets related to unconsolidated VIEs represents the maximum exposure to loss.

### Lime

Uber has investments in Lime, a company operating dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. These investments expose Uber to Lime's economic risks and rewards.

### Moove

Uber has entered into agreements with Moove, a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including an equity investment through preferred shares.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. It also contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.

## Overview

Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Additionally, Uber is involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday problems.

## Driver Classification Developments

Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative, went into effect in December 2020 to provide a framework for drivers working on platforms like Uber. The company has incurred additional expenses to comply with Proposition 22, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers and insurance for injury protection.

In the UK, a tribunal ruled that drivers should be classified as "workers" rather than independent contractors. The Supreme Court of the UK upheld this ruling in February 2021. Uber initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers, including back pay, holiday pay, and minimum wage. More than 70,000 mobility drivers in the UK will now be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage and receiving other benefits.

These developments may have financial implications for Uber but are not expected to have a material impact on the company's business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In the first quarter of 2022, Uber's MAPCs were 115 million, declining 3 million, or 3%, quarter-over-quarter, but growing 17% compared to the same period in 2021. The quarter-over-quarter decline in MAPCs was related to a slower start to the first quarter of 2022 due to impacts from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, followed by consumer activity increases through the remainder of the first quarter of 2022.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Components of Results of Operations

We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, or grocery delivery service.

## Revenue

During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these markets, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.

## Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, mobile device costs, and costs incurred for mobility or delivery services where we are primarily responsible.

## Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses include compensation expenses for employees supporting operations, customer support, and Driver background checks.

## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include compensation costs, advertising costs, loyalty programs, promotions, and credits provided to end-users. Expenses are expensed as incurred.

## Research and Development

Research and development expenses include compensation costs for employees in engineering, design, and product development. Expenses are incurred for ongoing improvements and maintenance of existing products and services.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:

- Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.
- Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.
- Gain on business divestiture.
- Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.
- Impairment of equity method investment.
- Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (“MLU B.V. Call Option”).
- Other, net.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.

Equity Method Investments

Equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

## Summary of Financial Performance

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. reported the following financial highlights:

### Mobility Segment

Adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily due to higher Mobility revenue, partially offset by increased insurance expenses and credit card processing costs.

### Delivery Segment

Delivery revenue increased by $771 million, or 44%, with Delivery adjusted EBITDA growing by $230 million, or 115%. The increase in revenue was driven by higher Delivery Gross Bookings and improved Take Rate.

### Freight Segment

Freight revenue surged by $1.5 billion, or 506%, with Freight adjusted EBITDA growing by $31 million, or 107%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of Transplace and growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network.

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

### Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.

### Investment Risk

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.

### Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

## Legal Actions and Investigations

Uber is involved in legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. The company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could impact its consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.

## Risk Factors

Various factors may have a material adverse effect on Uber's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Some of the key risks include:

- The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Uber's business.
- The classification of Drivers as employees, workers, or independent contractors.
- Competition in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries.
- Significant losses incurred by Uber since inception.
- The importance of maintaining and enhancing Uber's brand and reputation.
- Challenges related to workplace culture and operational compliance.
- The need to optimize organizational structure and manage growth effectively.
- Risks associated with criminal or dangerous activities by platform users.
- Investments in new offerings and technologies.

These risks could adversely affect Uber's financial performance and future prospects.

# Risks Related to Uber Technologies, Inc. Business

## General Economic Risks

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility

## Specific Risks

- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

## Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Uber's financial results in the near term and may continue to impact its long-term financial performance. The company has taken various actions to mitigate these impacts, including workforce reductions and changes to pricing models.

Uber is facing challenges related to driver supply constraints, with consumer demand for mobility recovering faster than driver availability. The suspension of shared rides offerings globally has also impacted the company's operations.

The ultimate impact of the pandemic on Uber's business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations remains uncertain and dependent on various factors such as the duration of the outbreak, vaccine efficacy, and global economic conditions.

## Operational Risks

Uber's business could be adversely affected if drivers are classified as employees, workers, or quasi-employees. The classification of drivers is being challenged in courts and by government agencies, with potential legal and financial implications for the company.

Changes to laws governing the classification of independent contractors, such as California's Assembly Bill 5 and Proposition 22, could impact Uber's operations and require compliance with new regulations.

Legal challenges and uncertainties surrounding the classification of drivers may pose risks to Uber's business and financial condition in the future.

We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our

# Competition Overview

Uber faces competition in each of its offerings, including:

## Mobility:

Competes with personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, and other ridesharing companies.

## Delivery:

Competes with companies in the meal, grocery, and other delivery space, as well as restaurants and traditional grocers.

## Freight:

Competes with global and North American freight brokers.

Competitors offer discounted services, incentives, and alternative pricing models, posing challenges to Uber's market position.

Uber is contractually restricted from competing with minority-owned affiliates in certain regions until specific dates.

# Market Strategy

To remain competitive, Uber has lowered fares, offered Driver incentives, and consumer promotions, impacting its financial performance.

Driver incentives and discounts are used to generate network scale and liquidity, especially in regions where Uber does not have a leading position.

There is a risk associated with the effectiveness of offering such incentives and promotions.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and service fees have negatively affected Uber's financial performance. Pricing models for consumer fares and Driver earnings have been modified over time and may continue to change in the future. Uber faces competition from well-capitalized competitors who may lower prices, offer incentives, or attract users away from Uber's platform.

Uber has incurred significant losses since inception, with operating losses of $4.9 billion in 2020 and $3.8 billion in 2021. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. Operating expenses are expected to increase, and profitability may not be achieved or maintained in the foreseeable future.

Uber's success depends on attracting and maintaining a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to its platform. Driver supply constraints, impacted by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect liquidity and network scale in geographic markets. Competition and other factors could make Uber's platform less appealing to users, impacting financial results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.

In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. The company has limited experience operating in many international jurisdictions and has been making significant investments to expand its international operations and compete with local and global competitors.

Operating internationally poses various risks that are not as prevalent in the United States. Some of these risks include operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences, localization of business operations to adhere to foreign laws and regulations, competition with local companies that have better market understanding, and legal uncertainties regarding liability for platform users' actions.

Other challenges include managing international operations, dealing with currency exchange fluctuations, navigating different payment methods preferred in various markets, complying with diverse tax systems, and facing political, social, and economic instability in foreign countries.

These risks and challenges could impact Uber's financial results and future prospects if not managed effectively.

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.

Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:

- grow supply and demand on our platform;
- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;
- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;
- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and
- increase positive perception of our brand.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,

Failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.

We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.

In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.

In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.

If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Attracting and retaining personnel is crucial for Uber's effective business operations. The equity incentives used to motivate employees may be less effective if the stock value does not meet expectations.

Economic conditions, including consumer spending trends, can impact Uber's performance. Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and energy prices can influence consumer behavior and affect Uber's business.

Rising costs due to inflation, fuel prices, and supply chain challenges can negatively impact Uber's operating results. These increased costs may lead to drivers and merchants spending less time on the platform.

Security breaches or unauthorized access to data pose significant risks to Uber. Any loss of data or breach of security could result in revenue loss, harm to the brand, and business disruption.

Uber faces challenges in anticipating and preventing security threats, which could lead to data breaches or disruptions in operations. Significant resources may be required to protect against such risks.

This document contains information about the security breaches and data incidents faced by Uber Technologies, Inc. in the past and potential risks in the future.

## Security Breaches and Data Incidents

Uber has experienced security and privacy incidents in the past, such as the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach, which exposed personal information of drivers and consumers. These incidents could lead to liabilities under various laws and regulations, as well as litigation and governmental investigations.

## Liabilities and Risks

Uber may face liabilities for breaches experienced by acquired companies like Careem and Drizly. Failure to remediate data security incidents could result in harm to the brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

## Product Development and User Retention

Uber needs to introduce new products and features to retain and attract drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. Failure to do so may adversely affect operating results.

## Operational Metrics and Challenges

Uber tracks operational metrics internally, which may differ from third-party estimates. Inaccuracies in metrics could harm reputation and negatively affect the business.

Below are some key points from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission:

1. Uber faces challenges related to the use of multiple accounts by consumers, inaccuracies in operating metrics, and regulatory concerns regarding cash payments in certain jurisdictions.

2. Cash payments for trips and deliveries accounted for approximately 7% of global Gross Bookings in 2021, with potential for increase in the future.

3. The use of cash raises regulatory, operational, and safety concerns, including compliance risks and safety incidents for both Drivers and riders.

4. Loss or modification of credit card acceptance privileges could significantly impact Uber's business model, as 74% of Gross Bookings were paid by credit or debit cards in 2021.

5. Cyberattacks, including malware and phishing attacks, pose a threat to Uber's reputation and operations.

This document contains information about the business operations and financial results of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

Below is an excerpt from the report discussing the company's reliance on information technology systems and the potential risks associated with cyberattacks:

We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.

Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.

Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.

We face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.

We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.

We have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

Dependencies on Third Parties

The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.

Our business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.

Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.

We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive

Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect Uber's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. The company is a U.S.-based multinational subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, and uncertainties remain regarding its impact on Uber's operations.

## Impact of Tax Reforms

Uber faces potential adverse impacts from changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies, and practices in jurisdictions where it operates. These changes could increase tax liabilities, affect financial position, operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates, and increase the complexity of tax compliance.

## Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of December 31, 2021, Uber had significant net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The expiration of these carryforwards could impact future taxable income and potentially affect operating results.

## Currency Exchange Rate Exposure

Uber faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These fluctuations can impact revenue, expenses, and overall financial results.

## Business Acquisitions and Integration

Uber's strategy includes acquiring businesses, and the success of these acquisitions and their integration is crucial. Failure to identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses could harm operating results and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber's platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. The company faces regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by competitors or local governments globally, which may favor local or incumbent competitors. There are increasing proposals for regulations that could significantly impact Uber's business model and operations.

Uber is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect its business and future prospects. Existing and new laws and regulations could expose Uber to substantial liability and increase operating costs. The company is actively challenging some laws and regulations that limit its ability to offer products to drivers and consumers in certain jurisdictions.

Uber is also impacted by environmental regulations related to air pollution and emissions, with initiatives such as adding clean-air fees and transitioning to electric vehicles in certain regions. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to data sharing requirements in various jurisdictions.

Following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ("Brexit") on January 1, 2021, Uber's operations in the UK represented approximately 8.9% of its global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.

Uber is involved in litigation in multiple jurisdictions, with legal challenges initiated by the company and brought by various parties including taxicab owners, regulators, and platform users. These legal proceedings are costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in financial damages or penalties if resolved adversely to Uber.

Despite divesting certain assets of its dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers still have access to these services through Uber's app, presenting additional risks distinct from other offerings.

Overall, Uber faces a complex regulatory and legal landscape that poses challenges to its business operations and growth prospects.

Disclaimer: This is a summary of information extracted from a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For comprehensive details, refer to the original document on the SEC website.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Below are some excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

Using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.

Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient.

## Payment Operations and Regulations

The company's payment operations are subject to evolving laws related to money transmission and online payments. Changes in these laws could impact Uber's ability to provide payment processing services on its platform. Compliance with financial regulations, including anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, is crucial for the company's operations.

## Government Investigations

Uber is currently facing inquiries and investigations from various government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and state Attorney General offices. These inquiries cover a range of matters such as business practices, data privacy incidents, and regulatory compliance. Adverse outcomes from these investigations could have a negative impact on Uber's business.

### Examples of Past Settlements and Fines

Uber has settled claims related to incidents such as the 2016 data breach, resulting in significant fines and penalties. For instance, settlements with U.S. state Attorneys General and regulatory bodies have amounted to millions of dollars. Ongoing regulatory investigations and litigation pose additional risks to the company.

### Impact on Business and Reputation

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the risks related to data privacy and security as disclosed by Uber Technologies, Inc. in their quarterly report.

## Risks Related to Data Privacy and Security

Uber Technologies, Inc. faces various risks related to the collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and processing of data, which could lead to investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory actions, and negative press about their privacy and data protection practices.

### Legal Actions and Settlements

Uber has been subject to various legal actions, settlements, and fines imposed by regulatory authorities. For example, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations. Additionally, settlements and fines have been imposed by authorities in the UK, Dutch, French, and US states for data security incidents.

### Compliance with Data Privacy Laws

Uber faces challenges in complying with data privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Non-compliance with these laws can result in significant penalties, fines, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.

### Expansion and Compliance Costs

As Uber expands its operations domestically and internationally, it may become subject to amended or additional data privacy and security laws, increasing compliance costs and risks associated with non-compliance. Jurisdictions like Brazil have also introduced data protection laws that impact Uber's operations.

### Insurance Coverage

Uber's insurance programs may not cover all potential claims related to data security incidents, leaving the company exposed to significant liabilities that could impact its business and financial condition.

Overall, Uber Technologies, Inc. faces ongoing challenges and risks related to data privacy and security, which require continuous monitoring and compliance efforts to mitigate potential financial and operational impacts.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.

Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject. We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.

Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform. Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.

We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.

In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.

We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.

We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be

The market price of Uber's common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly due to various factors beyond the company's control. These factors include:

- Fluctuations in financial results such as MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, and revenue
- Announcements or estimates regarding changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on the platform
- Differences between actual operating results and expectations of management, analysts, and investors
- Changes in accounting principles or interpretations
- Actions of securities analysts and changes in financial estimates
- Announcements by Uber or competitors regarding products, features, acquisitions, partnerships, or capital commitments

- External events like wars, terrorism, natural disasters, and pandemics

Stock price fluctuations in the market can impact Uber's stock price irrespective of its operating performance. Securities litigation and regulatory challenges could also affect the company's stock price and business operations.

Delaware law and provisions in Uber's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make certain corporate actions difficult, potentially affecting the trading price of the common stock.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;
Limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes;
Prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and
Our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.

These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.

## General Risk Factors

As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose
